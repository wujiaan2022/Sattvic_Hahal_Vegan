“Basing our diets around plant foods (like vegetables, fruits, whole grains, and beans), which contain fiber and other nutrients, can reduce our risk of cancer. ”<br>
World Cancer Research Fund and the American Institute for Cancer Research, Cancer Prevention Recommendations

“Everyone knows good nutrition supports your overall health, but few realize that certain foods—power foods—can protect your brain and optimize its function, and even dramatically reduce your risk of Alzheimer’s disease. ”<br>
Neal Barnard, MD, FACC, President, Physicians Committee

“A plant-based diet is a powerful tool for preventing, managing, and even reversing type 2 diabetes. Not only is this the most delicious ‘prescription’ you can imagine, but it’s also easy to follow. Unlike other diets, there’s no calorie counting, no skimpy portions, and no carb counting. Plus, all the ‘side effects’ are good ones. ”<br>
Neal Barnard, MD, FACC, President, Physicians Committee

#### 3. Validator Testing
- HTML
    - No errors were returned when passing through the official W3C validator
- CSS
    - No errors were found when passing through the official (Jigsaw) validator
- Unfixed Bugs
    - Django Messages Display Issue:<br>
    There's a current limitation concerning the display of Django messages. Instead of the expected "X" icon that usually appears for closing or dismissing the message, a thick underscore is being displayed at the end of the message. We're aware of this anomaly and are actively looking into a resolution. In the interim, users can still dismiss the message as usual; however, the visual representation will not be as intended.
